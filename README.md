SigMem is a meme rating application which dynamically tracks and consistently updates the global rankings of all uploaded memes. Memes are downvoted and upvoted using the same “SWIPE LEFT”/“SWIPE RIGHT” functionality employed on dating sites. Users can view and rate all uploaded memes using the GENERAL/GLOBAL tab or filter their settings using subject genre tabs. If the desired tab doesn’t exist, users can create it. IN addition to global aggregate standings, each tab will also have its own topic-specifc podium which updates dynamically.
Users can connect with each other and if you have connected with someone , then you can send memes to each others queue
