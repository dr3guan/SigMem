\f0\fs24 \cf0 Meme Tinder is a meme rating application which dynamically tracks and consistently updates the global rankings of all uploaded memes. Memes are downvoted and upvoted using the same \'93SWIPE LEFT\'94/\'93SWIPE RIGHT\'94 functionality employed on dating sites. Users can view and rate all uploaded memes using the GENERAL/GLOBAL tab or filter their settings using subject genre tabs. If the desired tab doesn\'92t exist, users can create it. IN addition to global aggregate standings, each tab will also have its own topic-specifc podium which updates dynamically.\
Users can connect with each other and if you have connected with someone , then you can send memes to each others queue\
